A version number `remVersion` is incremented each time `main.py` is run. It resets back to 0 after it hit 15. This versions is embedded into the code, in the variable `REM_LOCAL_VERSION` (look in `BaseTypes.h` and `BaseTypes.py`). The current version is stored in the file `latest_rem_version.txt`. Versioning has been added to be able to check that all robots / basestations / scripts run the same version of REM. The REM version is added to most packet, via the `remVersion` variable. To generate a specific version, run `main.py --version <your version number here>`. An example; If the basestation receives a packet from a robot which contains `remVersion = 5`, but its `REM_LOCAL_VERSION = 6`, then you know that the robot runs an outdated REM version.
