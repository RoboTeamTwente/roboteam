- Geometry (Polygon, Rectangle, Triangle, Line, etc.)
  - Intersections
  - Area  
  - Distances
- Vector calculus
  - Distances
  - Intersections
  - Length of vectors
- Angles
  - Rotating
- Timing 
  - Measurement, 
  - Looping at a given frequency
- Algorithms
  - The linear assignment problem (Hungarian)
